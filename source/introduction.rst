What is a theorem? What is a proof?
-----------------------------------

The principal aim of this module is for you to learn how to create and write mathematical proofs.
In the process, you will learn topics that will be fundamental for every pure mathematics module in
the remainder of your degree.

A theorem is the assertion that a particular statement (the goal or target) can be derived from
given assumptions (called premises or hypotheses) by a logically rigorous process.

Here's a simple example.

.. proof:theorem::

  Let :math:`x` be an integer, given :math:`x+2 = 5`, we have :math:`x=3` or :math:`x=0`.

In the above theorem, the statement to be derived, the goal, is ':math:`x=3` or :math:`x=0`'.
The hypotheses are that :math:`x` is an integer and that :math:`x+2=5`.

Proof is a more tricky matter. How much detail one needs to provide will depend on the situation
in question. If the problem is to prove :math:`1+1=2`, it isn't sufficient to claim that the result
is obviously true, but one may freely use this fact in proving a more complicated result such as
the binomial theorem.
